# Glasses-Alert-System
A pair of glasses that when worn, a user can walk around avoiding walls and objects at eye height. If a wall or object gets too close, the glasses will alarm the user allowing them to avoid head injuries.

My goal
This project involves designing a pair of glasses that help users detect walls and obstacles at eye level. The system uses a small distance sensor mounted on the front of the frame to measure how close an object is. When the user approaches a wall or object, the glasses play an audio alert that grows louder as the distance decreases. The goal is to help visually impaired users move more safely while keeping their hands free.

The setup includes an ultrasonic sensor, a microcontroller, and a buzzer. The microcontroller reads distance data and adjusts the audio output based on how close the user is to an obstacle. The warning sound stays silent when nothing is nearby and becomes increasingly urgent when the user gets too close. This creates an intuitive and easy to understand navigation aid.

These glasses are designed to reduce collisions with low hanging objects, open doors, and other hazards that can be difficult to detect. The system is lightweight, simple to wear, and easy to expand with future upgrades such as vibration alerts or additional sensors. 

As a small note, this project is still in progress and has not yet been completed.
